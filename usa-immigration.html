  <div class="article-content">
    <p>The Trump administration's 'Operation Metro Surge,' deploying 3,000 federal immigration agents into Minneapolis and other cities, has sparked more than 300 anti-ICE protests across the nation on February 3, while federal courts have rendered split decisions on its legality. A federal judge in Minnesota rejected state officials' request for a temporary injunction to halt the operation, despite documented fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens by federal agents and numerous complaints of illegal detention of U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of protesters have participated in nationwide demonstrations and strikes calling for ICE's abolishment. The city of Chicago issued an executive order on February 2 instructing local law enforcement to investigate and document reports of illegal activity by federal immigration agents, making it the first municipality to establish formal accountability mechanisms for federal enforcement operations.</p>
<p>Former CNN anchor Don Lemon and journalist Georgia Fort were released from federal custody on February 2 after their arrest for reporting on a peaceful protest in St. Paul. The arrests have raised concerns among press freedom advocates about the treatment of journalists covering immigration enforcement operations.</p>
<p>The operation has generated significant political controversy, with Democrats criticizing the scale and tactics of the enforcement actions, while some Republicans have questioned the administration's initial portrayal of events. Civil rights organizations have documented numerous cases of U.S. citizens being detained, some for extended periods, during the enforcement sweeps.</p>
