  <div class="article-content">
    <p>The U.S. Justice Department released more than 3 million pages of documents related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein on February 3, concluding a yearslong sealed records review. Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche announced that the review had concluded and prosecution of additional individuals was unlikely. However, investigations into the Justice Department's handling of the sensitive materials have intensified, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that 43 survivors' names were left unredacted in the publicly released files, raising questions about institutional safeguards and victim protection protocols.</p>

    <p>The disclosure marks the final major release of documents from Epstein's estate following his 2019 death in custody. The files contain correspondence, financial records, and testimony spanning decades. Civil rights advocates have criticized the redaction process and urged accountability mechanisms for federal agencies managing sensitive victim information. The development occurs amid ongoing scrutiny of law enforcement agencies' treatment of abuse survivors' personal data.</p>

    <p>The massive document release includes previously sealed court records, financial transactions, and communications that shed light on Epstein's network of associates and operations. Legal experts have noted that while the release provides transparency into the case, the failure to properly redact survivors' identities represents a significant breach of protocol that could have lasting consequences for those affected.</p>

    <p>Federal officials have acknowledged the redaction failures and initiated an internal review to determine how the sensitive information was left exposed. The incident has prompted calls for enhanced oversight of document release procedures, particularly in cases involving vulnerable individuals and sealed court records.</p>
